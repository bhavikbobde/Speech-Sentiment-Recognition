# AURORA: Voice Emotion Explorer

## Overview

AURORA is an advanced speech emotion recognition system that uses deep learning and robust audio processing to classify emotions from voice recordings. With a modern, interactive web interface, AURORA delivers high-accuracy emotion detection and visualization for research, education, and practical applications.

## Key Features

- **Sophisticated Audio Processing:** Extracts MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast, and other features for comprehensive signal analysis.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Uses SMOTE oversampling and dynamic class weighting for balanced model training.
- **Optimized Deep Learning Model:** Employs a CNN-BiLSTM neural network with focal loss for superior emotion classification.
- **Modern Streamlit Web App:** Provides an intuitive, visually appealing interface for uploading and analyzing speech files.
- **Comprehensive Metrics:** Displays detailed confusion matrices, class-wise accuracy, and probability distributions for transparent evaluation.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric              | Value      |
|---------------------|------------|
| Overall Accuracy    | 85%        |
| F1 Score            | 83%        |
| Per-class Accuracy  | >75%       |

The system achieves strong, research-grade performance on the RAVDESS dataset, maintaining high accuracy across all emotion categories.
